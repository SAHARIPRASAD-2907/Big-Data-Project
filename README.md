## Instructions to Run the project 

> Folder: final-project-code

Step1: Have a python version greater than 3.8
Step2: Create a Virtual Environment and activate it
Step3: Install packages using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
Step4: Run the below command

```python3 report_1.py <file_path_1> <file_path_2> <file_path_3>```
Where
file_path_1 = path for data science salaries (ds_salaries.csv)
file_path_2 = path for Smart home data (HomeC.csv)
file_path_3 = path for Sampled Smart home data (HomeC.csv)

- The 3rd file is generated by taking 40 entries from each month from the pre_processed_data.csv.
- Taking first 500 samples from original data cannot work correctly for time series analysis, regression analysis, anomaly detection
and clustering as our analysis involves averaging out monthly data and performing analysis.

- On successful completion 2 folders will be generated
- Logs Folder: With the outputs used for writing report with the full data.
- Graphs Folder: With the images generated used in final report anf first report.
